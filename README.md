# Overview of setting up a pipeline to verify dataset consistency using DVC:

1. **Objective**: Verify dataset consistency using climatological data collected from National Centers for Environmental Information, including monthly aggregates.

2. **Pipeline Components**:
   - Acquire data from NCEI.
   - Extract monthly aggregates.
   - Compare extracted aggregates with computed monthly averages.
   - Compute R2 score for consistency evaluation.

3. **Process Steps**:
   1. Refer to the provided slideshow for pipeline setup guidance.
   2. Install Git and DVC for source control and pipeline management.
   3. Create a GitHub project and initialize a folder to hold parameters, source code, data, and outputs.
   4. Initiate DVC in the project folder to link it with Git.
   5. Setup pipeline stages using `dvc stage add` command, updating `dvc.yaml` and `dvc.lock` files.
   6. Visualize the pipeline DAG with `dvc dag`.
   7. Run the pipeline with `dvc repro`, allowing parameter changes to trigger pipeline runs.
   8. Utilize `dvc exp show` to list experiment runs.
   9. Compare experiments using `dvc params diff`.
   10. Ensure all experiment versions are checked into DVC and GitHub for version control.

This process ensures efficient pipeline management and consistent evaluation of dataset integrity using DVC.
